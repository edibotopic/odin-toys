# Sqong

v0.1

Pong-clone written in the Odin language using the Raylib engine.
Made in a weekend to learn Odin and take a break from web projects.

To compile and run you need to have Odin installed and on your path.

```odin
cd sqong
odin build .
./sqong
```

# Audio

Music and score FX are original compositions.

Collision FX were made by mouth.

You are free to reuse both.

# Scope

This is (currently) a bare bones implementation.

Your player is on the left, the CPU player is on the right.
The game is first to 4.

That's it.

# To-do

These things may never happen.

- Menu with choices for theme/difficulty/audio
- Visible countdown before each serve
- Matches and games with side-switching
- Stress/stamina/aggression meter(s)
- Music adapts to game situation
- Game modes
- Additional strike styles (chip, arrow/straight, powershot)
- Pseudo-3D (ball scales close to net, casts a shadow)
- Context-dependent physics (grass level [no slide], ice level [slide], etc.)
